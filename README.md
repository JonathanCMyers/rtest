# rtest
Makeshift webpage to test R code without needing to have R installed on the computer (or mobile device) the user is testing on.  
  
  
This webpage was developed because I found myself wanting to test various R scripts on the fly (random number simulator, quick variance calculator, etc.), and I did not always have access to a computer with R installed. Now, I am able to test my scripts on any device that allows internet connectivity.
